# AgilA8 - an 8-bit Microcontroller
Agila is Tagalog for "eagle" - specifically evoking the Philippine Eagle (Haribon), the country's national bird. AgilA8 pairs that with A8, the name of the CPU core at the center of the design: Agil + A8 = AgilA8, the two overlapping on a shared capital A.

## How it works

AgilA8 is a compact 8-bit microcontroller built around A8, a custom
16-instruction CPU (see `docs/ISA.md`), with memory-mapped GPIO, a 16-bit
timer, and PWM generation.

Both instruction and data memory live off-chip on the Tiny Tapeout QSPI
Pmod. Program code is fetched from external SPI flash (CS0) using a
standard `03h` Read Data command; data memory lives on one of the
Pmod's two PSRAM chips (RAM A / CS1) using standard `02h`/`03h`
Write/Read commands. A third front-end, a general-purpose SPI master
for driving an external device (an LCD, an ADC, another MCU - anything
that isn't the flash/PSRAM already covered), shares the same physical
lines using the Pmod's previously-unused CS2 ("RAM B", never actually
populated on the real Pmod). This keeps the on-chip design small enough
to fit a 1x2 tile budget - Tiny Tapeout's own RAM32 macro is *half* the
size of this design's DMEM and needs 3x2 tiles on its own, so a plain
on-chip flip-flop array was never going to fit. Only plain, single-line
SPI commands are used for flash/PSRAM - deliberately not flash's
continuous-read mode or PSRAM's QPI mode, both of which need a
mode-byte/setup sequence that's easy to get subtly wrong without
hardware to verify against.

All three front-ends (flash, PSRAM, and the general-purpose SPI
controller) are driven by one shared SPI shift engine rather than three
separate FSMs, since they're never active at the same time (see below)
and consolidating saves real area - roughly 85 flip-flops for the
shared engine plus three thin front-ends, versus about 196 flip-flops
for three independent controllers.

Because `imem_valid` and `dmem_valid` are never asserted in the same
cycle (fetch and memory-access are separate, sequential states in the
core's FSM), and the DMEM-side peripherals are mutually exclusive by
address decode, the shared engine can grant flash/PSRAM/SPI with a
simple fixed-priority mux rather than needing real bus arbitration -
by construction, at most one of the three is ever requesting at once.

### Address map

| Address range | Device                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 0x00 - 0xEF, 0xF5 - 0xF7 | RAM (external PSRAM, RAM A)   |
| 0xF0 - 0xF2    | GPIO                                    |
| 0xF3 - 0xF4    | SPI (general-purpose)                   |
| 0xF8 - 0xFB    | Timer                                   |
| 0xFC - 0xFD    | PWM                                     |

> **Note:** `0xF3`/`0xF4` used to be plain RAM in earlier revisions of
> this design. They now belong to the general-purpose SPI controller
> (see below) - any program that stored ordinary data at those two
> addresses will now silently hit the SPI controller instead of RAM.

Instructions are fetched separately, as two consecutive bytes from
external flash (big-endian: high byte at PC, low byte at PC+1) - flash
isn't part of the 8-bit DMEM address space above.

### IO

| # | Input       | Output       | Bidirectional                    |
| - | ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| 0 | GPIO in 0   | GPIO out 0   | Flash CS (CS0)                    |
| 1 | GPIO in 1   | GPIO out 1   | SD0 - MOSI (shared flash/PSRAM)   |
| 2 | GPIO in 2   | GPIO out 2   | SD1 - MISO (shared flash/PSRAM)   |
| 3 | GPIO in 3   | GPIO out 3   | SCK (shared flash/PSRAM)          |
| 4 | GPIO in 4   | GPIO out 4   | SD2 (held high, unused)           |
| 5 | GPIO in 5   | GPIO out 5   | SD3 (held high, unused)           |
| 6 | GPIO in 6   | GPIO out 6   | RAM A CS (CS1)                    |
| 7 | GPIO in 7   | PWM output   | SPI CS (CS2, general-purpose SPI)  |


#### GPIO

| Register | Address     | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GPIO_OUT | 0xF0 (R/W)  | Write sets `uo_out[6:0]`; read returns the last value written    |
| GPIO_IN  | 0xF1 (R)    | Reads the current state of `ui_in[7:0]`                          |
| GPIO_DIR | 0xF2 (R/W)  | Read/write register; not wired to anything (`ui_in`/`uo_out` are fixed-direction TT pins, so there's no direction to control) |

`uo_out[7]` is dedicated to the PWM output, not GPIO - a write of
`0xAA` to GPIO_OUT reads back as `0xAA` internally, but only
`uo_out[6:0]` (`0x2A` in that example) reaches a physical pin.

#### SPI (general-purpose)

A separate SPI master for driving an external device that isn't the
flash/PSRAM already covered above (an LCD, an ADC, another MCU, etc.),
using CS2 - the Pmod's second PSRAM chip-select, never actually
populated on the real board.

| Register | Address     | Description                                                        |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SPI_DATA | 0xF3 (R/W)  | Write: shifts the byte out (CS auto-asserted for the transfer, **blocking** until the 8-bit transfer physically completes). Read: returns the byte simultaneously shifted in from MISO during the most recent transfer, without starting a new one - to read a byte from a slave, write a dummy `0x00` and then read DATA back (standard full-duplex SPI) |
| SPI_CTRL | 0xF4 (R/W)  | Bits[1:0] = SCK clock divider: `00` = fastest (~sys_clk/2, matches flash/PSRAM speed), `01` = ~sys_clk/8, `10` = ~sys_clk/32, `11` = ~sys_clk/128 (**reset default** - start slow, let software speed up once the attached device's timing is known to tolerate it) |

Each `SPI_DATA` write is deliberately blocking rather than
fire-and-forget: the core has no instruction cache, so the very next
instruction fetch also needs this same shared bus. Blocking keeps this
peripheral's transfers inside the same single-active-transaction
invariant the shared engine already depends on for flash/PSRAM, with no
separate arbitration hardware needed. CS is likewise auto-pulsed per
byte (asserted only during the active transfer) rather than held low
across a logical multi-byte burst - genuinely continuous bursts aren't
possible on this hardware anyway, since unrelated flash-fetch traffic
would otherwise appear on the shared lines mid-burst; auto-pulsing at
least keeps CS deasserted while that happens, so the attached device
correctly ignores it.

#### Timer

| Register    | Address     | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TIMER_LO    | 0xF8 (R)    | Bits 7:0 of the free-running 16-bit counter                    |
| TIMER_HI    | 0xF9 (R)    | Bits 15:8 of the counter                                       |
| TIMER_CTRL  | 0xFA (R/W)  | Bit 0 = enable (counts up once per clock while set). Writing bit 1 = 1 resets the counter to 0 |
| TIMER_FLAG  | 0xFB (R/W)  | Bit 0 = overflow (set when the counter wraps past 0xFFFF); any write clears it |

#### PWM

| Register  | Address     | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PWM_DUTY  | 0xFC (R/W)  | 8-bit duty cycle out of a free-running 256-cycle period. `0xFF` is a special-cased always-on |
| PWM_CTRL  | 0xFD (R/W)  | Bit 0 = enable. Output is forced low whenever disabled, regardless of PWM_DUTY |

## How to test

1. Program the test image onto the Pmod's flash chip (`test/imem.hex`,
   built by `test/build_prog.py` - exercises every opcode plus the GPIO,
   timer, and PWM registers) and leave the PSRAM chip's contents as-is;
   the program initializes any RAM it depends on.
2. Reset the design (`rst_n` low then high).
3. Run the clock. The CPU fetches from flash and reads/writes RAM over
   the shared SPI bus automatically - no host intervention needed once
   running.
4. Check final state against the golden reference model
   (`test/golden.py`) - `test/TESTING.md` and `test/TESTING_round2.md`
   document the expected register values, and the pipeline this was
   last verified against.

Before committing to a tapeout, the QSPI Pmod flash-read timing margin
(`read_delay_cfg`, now handled centrally in `qspi_shared_engine.v`) is
worth validating on real hardware first, since interconnect delay isn't
visible in behavioral simulation - see the FPGA bring-up guide for the
Tiny Tapeout FPGA Development Kit + QSPI Pmod path used for that.

## External hardware

- [Tiny Tapeout QSPI Pmod](https://store.tinytapeout.com/products/QSPI-Pmod-p716541602),
  plugged into the demoboard's bidirectional Pmod header. One flash chip
  (program memory) and one of its two PSRAM chips (data memory) are
  used; the second PSRAM chip's chip-select (CS2) is repurposed for the
  general-purpose SPI controller instead - that chip itself is still
  unpopulated on the real Pmod, but its CS line now carries traffic for
  whatever external SPI device gets connected there.
- Tiny Tapeout demoboard, or the
  [FPGA Development Kit](https://store.tinytapeout.com/products/FPGA-Development-Kit-p813805747)
  for pre-tapeout bring-up on real silicon-adjacent hardware.

This file documents the open-source tools, process design kit, and prior
art that AbadMCU depends on or was inspired by. It's split into two
categories that are easy to conflate but legally distinct:

1. **Tools and IP actually incorporated into this design** - their

2. **Architectural inspiration from prior projects** - no code was
   copied from these; crediting them is good academic/community

## 2. Architectural inspiration (no code reused)

AgilA8's central design decision - CPU with no on-chip memory,
program fetched from external QSPI flash, working data in external
QSPI PSRAM, sharing physical SPI wires between them via a separate chip
selects - follows the same strategic pattern pioneered on Tiny Tapeout
by the following projects. **No RTL, ISA encoding, or source code from
either project was copied** - AgilA8's CPU core, instruction set, and
peripheral RTL were independently designed and implemented. What's
credited here is the *architectural pattern*, not any specific
implementation of it.

### TinyQV (Michael Bell)
First (and to date, most complete) demonstration of this
flash+PSRAM-over-shared-QSPI-Pmod pattern on Tiny Tapeout, including
the specific convention of a single active chip-select and
code-execution-restricted-to-flash.

Source: https://github.com/MichaelBell/tinyQV (Apache-2.0)

### KianV (Hirosh Dabui / splinedrive)
Independent, earlier demonstration of the same external-memory-over-QSPI
pattern (both the uLinux and bare-metal editions), predating this
project.

(check the repository's own LICENSE file directly before citing a
specific license - it wasn't confirmed via an explicit license badge
at the time this was written)

### RISC-V (conceptual influence only)
A8's `r0`-hardwired-to-zero convention and load/store architectural
style are modeled on RISC-V's design philosophy. RISC-V is an open,
freely usable ISA specification; no code is reused here, so this
carries no license obligation. **TT8 is not RISC-V-compliant** - it's
a custom 16-bit-instruction, 8-bit-datapath ISA in the RISC-V style,
and should not be described as a RISC-V implementation or use the
RISC-V trademark/logo.

---

## 3. What's original to this project

- The A8 instruction encoding (16-bit fixed-width, R-type/I-type
  split, the specific opcode table) is a custom design, not derived
  from any existing ISA's bit layout.
- All RTL in this repository (`a8_core.v`, `a8_alu.v`,
  `a8_regfile.v`, `a8_peripherals.v`, `qspi_shared_engine.v`,
  `spi_ctrl.v`, `tt_um_agila8.v`) was independently written for
  this project. `qspi_shared_engine.v` consolidates what were
  previously three separate controllers (`qspi_flash_reader.v` for
  flash, `qspi_psram_ctrl.v` for PSRAM, and `spi_ctrl.v` for the
  general-purpose SPI peripheral) into one shared engine - see that
  file's header for why, and `spi_ctrl.v`'s own header/testbench for
  the general-purpose SPI register semantics it still documents even
  though it isn't the module instantiated in the final design.
- The verification suite, bug fixes, and STA signoff analysis
  documented in this repository's history are this project's own work.

---

## Unverified claims to double-check before formal publication

- A code comment (originally in `qspi_flash_reader.v`, which may or may
  not still be present in the repo as reference material - it isn't
  part of the module actually instantiated after the merge) attributes
  a ~20ns round-trip timing margin figure to "TinyQV's own QSPI
  controller comments." This has not been independently confirmed
  against TinyQV's actual source - verify both the exact figure/its
  origin, and which file it currently lives in, before citing it as a
  TinyQV-derived fact.
- The Apache-2.0 NOTICE-file check above was only performed for
  skywater-pdk; confirm the other three Apache-2.0 entries (open_pdks,
  OpenLane, Tiny Tapeout templates) don't ship their own NOTICE files
  before finalizing this document, since if any of them do, its
  contents would need to be reproduced here per \u00a74(d).
